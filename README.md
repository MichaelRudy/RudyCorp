# RudyCorp
A platform for building scalable applications

### Goals
I am not overly familiar with web development, however, I decided to undertake this project as a way to display a portfolio of projects, hobbies, and interests.

I opted to go with Flask due to its minimalist framework and then found a couple of html and css templates that I could spin my portfolio website off of. 

Thus far, I have created an endpoint that displays projects from my GitHub account using a developer token. When deployed, I want my web application to automatically render newly created repos, including the project's name, description, and language used.
